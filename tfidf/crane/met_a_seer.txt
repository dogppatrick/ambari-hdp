I met a seer. 
He held in his hands 
The book of wisdom. 
"Sir," I addressed him, 
"Let me read." 
"Child -- " he began. 
"Sir," I said, 
"Think not that I am a child, 
For already I know much 
Of that which you hold. 
Aye, much." 

He smiled. 
Then he opened the book 
And held it before me. -- 
Strange that I should have grown so suddenly blind.
